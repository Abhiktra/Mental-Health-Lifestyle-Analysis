## 🧠 Insights Summary  

- **Exercise Level** has a small but measurable positive effect on happiness.  
- **Diet Type** significantly affects happiness — vegetarians reported the highest scores.  
- **Social Interaction** shows a weak negative relationship with happiness, indicating that quality matters more than quantity.  
- **Screen Time** negatively influences happiness levels, though not significantly.  
- **Gender and Diet Type** showed no statistical association.  
- Data followed an **approximate normal distribution**, allowing valid parametric tests.
